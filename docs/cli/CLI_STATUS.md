# Ember CLI Status

## Current Status

The Ember CLI is currently being developed separately from the core Python framework. It has been excluded from the main development workflow and git tracking to allow for independent development and prevent integration issues.

## Structure

The CLI is built with:
- TypeScript/Node.js
- Commander.js for command-line parsing
- Python-bridge for communication with the Python framework

## Key Components

1. **Command Modules**
   - model.ts - Manage LLM models
   - provider.ts - Manage providers
   - invoke.ts - Invoke models
   - config.ts - Manage configuration
   - project.ts - Project scaffolding
   - version.ts - Version information

2. **Services**
   - config-manager.ts - Manage CLI configuration
   - python-bridge.ts - Interface with the Python framework

3. **UI Components**
   - Spinners, progress bars, banners
   - Interactive prompts

## Integration Issues

The CLI currently has its own configuration management system separate from the centralized Python configuration. This leads to:

1. Separate storage of API keys and provider settings
2. Potential synchronization issues between CLI and Python configurations
3. Duplication of configuration logic

## Future Development

For future integration, the CLI should:

1. Use the centralized configuration system in Python
2. Implement bidirectional sync for configurations
3. Maintain a consistent schema for settings
4. Provide a consistent user experience across CLI and Python interfaces

## Development Plan

1. Complete the centralized configuration in Python
2. Develop a dedicated API for configuration access
3. Update the CLI to use this API
4. Implement testing for both components

## Usage

The CLI is currently excluded from the standard installation. When development resumes, it will be available as a separate package or optional component.
