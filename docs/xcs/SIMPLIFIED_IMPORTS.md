# Simplified XCS Import Structure

The XCS (eXecutable Computation System) module provides high-performance execution capabilities for computational graphs, just-in-time tracing, and parallel execution transformations.

## Before: Complex Import Paths

Previously, users needed to remember specific import paths:

```python
from ember.xcs.tracer.tracer_decorator import jit
from ember.xcs.tracer.autograph import AutoGraphBuilder
from ember.xcs.engine.xcs_engine import execute_graph
from ember.xcs.transforms.vmap import vmap
from ember.xcs.transforms.pmap import pmap
```

## After: Clean, Intuitive Imports

Now, all functionality is available through a clean, top-level API:

```python
# Simple function imports
from ember.xcs import jit, vmap, pmap, autograph, execute

# Or use the unified API
from ember.xcs import xcs

result = xcs.execute(graph, inputs={"query": "Example"})
```

## Design Principles

The new import structure follows key design principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each function has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Open for Extension**: The API can be extended without modifying existing code
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Types are properly defined with consistent interfaces
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clean, minimal interfaces for different use cases
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Components depend on abstractions rather than details

## Benefits

- **Discoverability**: Functions are easy to find and use
- **Consistency**: Follows the pattern of other Ember modules
- **Simplicity**: Hides implementation details behind a clean interface
- **Extensibility**: New functionality can be added without breaking changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old import paths still work

This redesign makes the XCS module more accessible while maintaining all its power and flexibility.
