# Complete Circular Import Fixes in Ember

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **EmberSettings Circular Import**:
   - Issue: `EmberSettings` was referenced in `discovery.py` but was missing in `settings.py`
   - Fix: Moved `EmberSettings` class to `ember.core.config.schema` where it logically belongs
   - Updated all references to import from the new location

2. **Field Import Missing**:
   - Issue: `Field` was imported from `ember.core.types.ember_model` but wasn't defined there
   - Fix: Added the Pydantic `Field` import to the `ember_model.py` file

3. **ModelDiscoveryError Import Issue**:
   - Issue: `ModelDiscoveryError` was imported from `base_discovery.py` but should be imported from `ember.core.exceptions`
   - Fix: Updated imports in all discovery provider files to import `ModelDiscoveryError` from the correct location

## Complete List of Changes Made

1. **Fixed EmberSettings circular import**:
   - Added `EmberSettings` class to `ember.core.config.schema`
   - Updated imports in `ember.core.registry.model.base.registry.discovery`
   - Updated imports in `ember.core.registry.model.__init__`
   - Removed temporary `EmberSettings` class from `settings.py`

2. **Fixed Field missing import**:
   - Added `Field` import to `ember.core.types.ember_model`:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field
   ```

3. **Fixed ModelDiscoveryError imports**:
   - Updated `ember.core.registry.model.providers.base_discovery`:
   ```python
   from ember.core.exceptions import ModelDiscoveryError, NotImplementedFeatureError
   ```

   - Updated `ember.core.registry.model.providers.anthropic.anthropic_discovery`:
   ```python
   from ember.core.exceptions import ModelDiscoveryError
   from ember.core.registry.model.providers.base_discovery import BaseDiscoveryProvider
   ```

   - Updated `ember.core.registry.model.providers.openai.openai_discovery`:
   ```python
   from ember.core.exceptions import ModelDiscoveryError
   from ember.core.registry.model.providers.base_discovery import BaseDiscoveryProvider
   ```

   - Updated `ember.core.registry.model.providers.deepmind.deepmind_discovery`:
   ```python
   from ember.core.exceptions import ModelDiscoveryError
   from ember.core.registry.model.providers.base_discovery import BaseDiscoveryProvider
   ```

## Testing Results

We've tested all our fixes with:

1. **Basic Component Tests**:
   - Successfully imported `Field` from `ember_model`
   - Successfully imported `EmberSettings` from `core.config.schema`
   - Successfully imported data base models

2. **Model Discovery Tests**:
   - Successfully imported `BaseDiscoveryProvider` without errors
   - Successfully imported `AnthropicDiscovery` without errors
   - Successfully imported `ModelDiscoveryError` from the correct location

3. **API Usage Tests**:
   - Successfully imported and instantiated `DatasetBuilder`
   - Successfully imported `datasets` function
   - Successfully imported `list_available_datasets` function

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues were:

1. **Improper Import Structure**:
   - Classes were imported from the wrong locations
   - Some classes were missing entirely
   - Some modules tried to re-export exceptions that should be imported directly

2. **Circular Dependencies**:
   - Low-level modules imported from higher-level modules
   - Core exceptions were imported from implementation modules

3. **Missing Re-exports**:
   - Some modules failed to re-export or directly export necessary classes

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Clear Dependency Hierarchy**:
   - Exceptions should be defined in a central location and imported directly
   - Base classes should be in lower levels and not import from higher levels
   - Implementation classes should import from core modules, not vice versa

2. **Import Best Practices**:
   - Use absolute imports for clarity
   - Avoid re-exporting classes through multiple modules
   - Keep import paths consistent

3. **Module Structure**:
   - Core types and exceptions should be in foundational modules
   - Implementation modules should depend on core modules
   - API modules should integrate everything but not be depended on by core modules

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the correct import patterns
   - Add examples showing the right way to import and use components

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Add tests specifically for imports to catch circular dependencies early
   - Include integration tests for the full API usage patterns
