# Ember Data API Analysis

## Summary of Findings

1. **Current Status of the Data API**:
   - The data API in Ember has a well-architected design with a clean separation of concerns
   - The core components (models, transformers, samplers, validators) are well-implemented
   - There are several circular import issues that prevent using the simplified API as shown in the README

2. **Main Issues Identified**:
   - Circular import involving `EmberSettings` - Missing class referenced in `discovery.py` but not defined
   - Additional import issues with the `Field` class from ember.core.types.ember_model
   - These issues make it difficult to use the high-level API in standalone scripts

3. **Working Functionality**:
   - The basic `data_api_example.py` works well and demonstrates the core concepts
   - The underlying data models and utilities are solid
   - Our standalone implementations of the data API work properly, following the patterns shown in the README

4. **Suggested Fixes**:
   - We've added the missing `EmberSettings` class to `settings.py`, fixing the immediate import error
   - To fully resolve all circular imports, the codebase would need a more thorough refactoring with improved dependency management
   - Consider restructuring the imports to have clearer layering - core utilities should not depend on higher-level modules

## Implementation Details from our Tests

1. **Standalone Data Module**:
   - Successfully implemented the base components (`DatasetEntry`, `DatasetInfo`, `TaskType`)
   - This implementation worked without any circular import issues

2. **Builder Pattern Implementation**:
   - Implemented the builder pattern shown in the README.md
   - Includes support for dataset loading, sampling, transformations, etc.
   - Demonstrated that the pattern in the README is valid and can work

3. **Evaluation Pipeline**:
   - Implemented a simplified evaluation pipeline with both standard and custom metrics
   - Demonstrated how metrics can be aggregated across a dataset
   - This matches the API shown in the README

## Recommendations

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Consider using a more layered architecture to prevent circular imports
   - The core utilities should have minimal dependencies and not import from higher-level modules
   - Implement clear interfaces between layers

2. **API Design**:
   - The current API design with builder patterns and fluent interfaces is excellent
   - Keep this design but ensure the implementation doesn't introduce circular dependencies

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update examples to clearly show standalone usage vs. integrated usage
   - Consider providing examples that don't rely on the full Ember framework

4. **Testing**:
   - Add more tests for standalone usage of data components
   - Ensure components can be used without importing the entire framework

## Development Plan

1. **Short-term Fix**:
   - We've added the missing `EmberSettings` class to fix the immediate error
   - For the `Field` error, need to investigate ember.core.types.ember_model

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Refactor the imports to break circular dependencies
   - Consider splitting large modules into smaller, more focused ones
   - Improve error handling for clearer diagnostics

3. **Long-term**:
   - Consider a more modular architecture where components like data, models, and operators are fully independent
   - Provide simplified standalone versions of components for users who don't need the full framework
