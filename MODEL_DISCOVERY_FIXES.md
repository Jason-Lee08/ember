# Ember Model Registry Enhancements

This document describes fixes made to the model discovery service to resolve hanging issues.

## Discovery Service Fixes

The model discovery service has been enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Thread Safety**: Proper lock handling ensures thread-safe model discovery
   - Fixed recursive locking issues with reentrant locks
   - Added lock ownership checks to prevent deadlocks
   - Reduced lock scope to minimize contention
2. **Timeout Protection**: Multi-level timeout handling prevents API calls from hanging
   - Per-provider timeouts (15 seconds each)
   - Aggressive connection timeouts in provider implementations (2s connect, 5s read)
   - Global timeout protection in test harness (30s overall)
3. **Import Fixes**: Removed redundant imports and fixed import scoping issues
   - Removed redundant `import time as time_module` and using top-level `time` import
   - Properly imported `ModelDiscoveryError` at the top level instead of inside methods
   - Added missing import of `time` in the `anthropic_discovery.py` file
4. **Fallback Handling**: Improved fallback model handling when API calls fail
5. **Error Handling**: Better error propagation and logging with specific timeouts
6. **Nested Lock Handling**: Fixed is_registered() to handle being called inside another locked context

## Key Components Modified

- `src/ember/core/registry/model/base/registry/model_registry.py`: Fixed locking issues
  - Modified is_registered() to use non-blocking lock acquisition for deadlock prevention
  - Fixed empty model_id handling to return False immediately
  - Eliminated reliance on private lock implementation details (_is_owned)
  - Restructured step 3 of discovery to minimize lock scope
  - Added more detailed logging for debugging lock issues

- `src/ember/core/registry/model/base/registry/discovery.py`: Main discovery service
  - Fixed redundant imports
  - Ensured proper thread safety with minimal lock scope
  - Improved error handling and timeout implementation
  - Clarified reentrant lock usage
  
- `src/ember/core/registry/model/providers/anthropic/anthropic_discovery.py`: Anthropic provider
  - Fixed time import
  - Added aggressive timeout (2s connect, 5s read) to prevent hanging
  - Fixed unit tests to properly test API key validation by clearing environment variables
  
- `test_discovery_fixed.py`: Enhanced test script with timeout protection
  - Added global timeout using signal-based approach
  - Improved diagnostic output
  - Added provider statistics for easier debugging

## Testing the Fixes

```bash
# Run the fixed discovery test
python test_discovery_fixed.py

# Run unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/core/registry/model/base/registry/discovery.py

# Test model discovery in isolation
poetry run pytest tests/unit/core/registry/model/base/registry/test_discovery.py::TestModelDiscovery::test_discovery_threaded
```

The fixes ensure that the model discovery service no longer hangs indefinitely when API calls timeout or fail, and properly handles recursive lock acquisitions.
