# Ember Data Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating Ember's data handling capabilities, including dataset loading, transformation, and evaluation.

## Examples

- `data_api_example.py` - Using the data API for dataset operations
- `mcq_experiment_example.py` - Multiple choice question experiments
- `transformation_example.py` - Data transformation and preprocessing

## Running Examples

To run any example, use the following command format:

```bash
poetry run python src/ember/examples/data/example_name.py
```

Replace `example_name.py` with the desired example file.

## Data Concepts

Ember provides tools for working with evaluation datasets and benchmarks, featuring:

- Standard dataset registry with common benchmarks
- Flexible loading and sampling API
- Transformation pipelines for preprocessing
- Evaluation tools for measuring model performance

## Next Steps

After learning about data handling, explore:

- `models/` - For model usage with datasets
- `advanced/` - For complex evaluation pipelines
