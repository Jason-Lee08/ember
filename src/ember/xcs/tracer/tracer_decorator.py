"""
Tracer Decorator for XCS Operators.

This module provides a decorator that instruments an Operator
subclass for execution tracing. Upon first invocation, the operator's execution is traced
symbolically. The tracer leverages PyTree flattening (via EmberModule) and
records operations into an IR graph (consisting of IRNode objects). Subsequent
calls execute the cached plan.

Allows optional forced tracing on every call and customizable caching logic.

    When applied, the operator's execution is traced on first call (or during initialization
    if sample_input is provided). A graph is automatically built based on the traces and
    cached for future use. Subsequent calls use the cached graph for efficient execution.

    Args:
        sample_input: Optional pre-defined input for compilation during initialization.
            If provided, the operator will be traced during initialization, and the
            resulting graph will be cached for future use.
        force_trace: If True, traces every invocation regardless of caching.
            Useful for debugging or when inputs might affect the execution graph.
            Defaults to False.
        recursive: If True, automatically handles nested operators.
            Currently limited to direct relationships observed during tracing.
